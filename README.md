# 🛡️ Incident Response & SOC Investigations

This repository contains **hands-on security incident investigations** conducted using real-world artifacts such as **PCAPs, email headers, HTTP traffic, and application logs**.

The focus of this repo is to demonstrate **practical incident response skills**, including detection, investigation, evidence analysis, and professional SOC documentation — following workflows used in real Security Operations Centers.

## 🔍 What This Repository Demonstrates

- Security alert triage and analyst validation  
- Network traffic analysis (PCAP-based investigations)

## 🧠 Analyst Approach

Each investigation follows a structured SOC workflow:

1. Alert or anomaly identification  
2. Manual analyst validation  
3. Evidence-driven investigation  
4. IOC extraction and correlation  
5. Incident classification  
6. Containment and mitigation recommendations  

The emphasis is on **how decisions are made**, not just tool output.
